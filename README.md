# Process-Teach-Program- 12/17/21: The program is complete for the HR3, Odessy, and RDX. 
I used two different algorithms to calculate for the increase/decrease of the shot time and mix ratio.
The 1st one is based off my previous data tracking the HR3 and uses small adjustemnts by just adding like .008 to the mix ratio when on the high side of the nominal
The 2nd apporach is based off taking the ild input and finding the differnce from the parts nominal ild and then uses that differnce to help find the increase/decrease shot time or mix ratio
